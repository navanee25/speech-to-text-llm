# speech-to-text-llm
📌 Speech to Text for Transcription Services
This project demonstrates how to convert spoken language into written text using automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is designed for transcription services and showcases the use of deep learning models to achieve accurate speech-to-text results.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this notebook is to:

Load and process audio files.

Extract meaningful audio features such as MFCCs.

Use a trained speech recognition model to transcribe audio into text.

Evaluate the performance of the transcription.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Librosa (for audio processing)

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on model)

Pretrained models (e.g., DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec2, etc.)
